### Establishing the Foundation

At OpenNode, I recognized the need for a unified design language as the product scaled across web and mobile platforms. While a fully coded design system was the long-term goal, the immediate priority was to stop the design debt and create a "single source of truth" for the design team.

I spearheaded the creation of the **OpenNode Design System Foundation**—a robust Figma-based system that standardized our UI and streamlined the design-to-development handover.

### Core Objectives

#### 1. Component Thinking & Atomization
I moved the team away from page-based design to a component-based mindset. By breaking interfaces down into atomic elements (buttons, inputs, typography styles), we ensured that every mockup produced was consistent by default. This "Figma-first" library allowed us to:
- Rapidly prototype new features using pre-approved blocks.
- Maintain visual consistency across different product verticals.
- Reduce decision fatigue for designers.

#### 2. Cross-Platform Considerations
The system wasn't just for the web dashboard. I established guidelines for how components should adapt between:
- **Web**: Responsive desktop and mobile web views.
- **Mobile App**: Native iOS and Android patterns.
This involved defining fluid typography, spacing tokens that worked on touch targets, and interaction states that made sense for both mouse and touch.

#### 3. Documentation & Standards
A design system is only as good as its documentation. I focused heavily on documenting the *intent* and *behavior* of components, not just their look.
- **Redlining & Specs**: Detailed annotations for developers on spacing, behavior, and edge cases.
- **Usage Guidelines**: Clear "Do's and Don'ts" for other designers on the team.
- **Implementation Roadmap**: While this was a design-side foundation, it was built with code in mind, using structure and naming conventions that mapped to standard CSS/development practices to ease the future engineering implementation.

### Results

This foundational work dramatically increased our design velocity. We stopped reinventing the wheel for every feature and started building a cohesive product ecosystem. It served as the critical bridge, preparing the organization for a full-scale code implementation while immediately solving consistency issues in our design output.
